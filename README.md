- Handles invalid operation input
- Great for beginners learning `input()`, `if-elif` logic, and basic arithmetic in Python

## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced

- Python syntax and indentation
- Handling user input
- Conditional statements
- Basic arithmetic logic

## ðŸ’¡ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3+ recommended), then:

```bash
python "mini calculator.py"
